The challenge here is to markup some code samples. 

Code is a tag. Any time you want to markup/identify code samples
in your content wrap it in the code tag. 

Code snippets are often formatted and the formatting matters! The 
browser removes formatting which creates a problem. To preserve 
formatting use the <pre> tag. 

  Imagine the content above contains two code snippets. One for the p 
  tag and the other for JavaScript. There are two sections each with 
  a heading and code snippet. 

  You may also need to use html entities for special characters
  that appear in a code snippet.
