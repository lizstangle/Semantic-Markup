<p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the standard markup language 
for creating web pages and web applications. With <abbr title="Cascading Style 
Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone 
technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]</p>

<p>browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
	local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
	HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
	originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
